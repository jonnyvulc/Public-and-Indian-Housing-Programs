The Budget includes $667 million for the renewal of Section 811 main- stream housing vouchers for persons with disabilities, including the first- time renewal of new mainstream vouchers allocated in 2022, and associated administrative fees, as well as a new set-aside to provide adjustments to PHAs as a result of significant increases in mainstream renewal costs res- ulting from unforeseen circumstances and to prevent the termination of assistance for mainstream families should there be insufficient funding.
The Budget also requests the following: $3.0 billion in PHA administrative fees to support core functions such as admitting households, conducting housing quality inspections, and completing tenant income certifications; $220 million for tenant protection vouchers, which are provided to families who may have to relocate due to actions beyond their control, such as a public housing demolition or redevelopment, and when private owners of multi-family developments choose to leave the project-based program or convert to long-term Section 8 contracts, including up to $20 million that may be used to assist low-income tenants referred by the Secretary of the Department of Argriculture (USDA) when section 521 assistance is no longer available to protect tenants due to the maturity, prepayment, or foreclosure of a section 514 or 515 loan, as part of the Budget's proposal to decouple USDA section 521 rental assistance from section 514 or 515 mortgage loans; and up to $5 million for the renewal of vouchers by Tribes under the Tribal Housing and Department of Housing and Urban Develop- ment and Department of Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program, to serve Native American veterans who are homeless or at risk of home- lessness and living in and around designated tribal areas.
In addition, the Budget includes $1.6 billion for new incremental vouchers for 200,000 additional households, including those who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness or fleeing or attempting to flee domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or human trafficking. The Budget also includes $445 million for Mobility Services, which will provide funding for services to better enable families with children to move to areas of higher opportunity. ✦

    The Budget provides $32.1 billion for the Tenant-Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) program (also known as the Housing Choice Voucher program), which is the Federal Government's largest income-targeted rental assistance program. The program currently provides housing assistance to around 2.3 million extremely low- to very low-income families to rent decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the private market. About 2,100 state and local Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) administer the Housing Choice Voucher program.
The Budget provides $26.2 billion in contract renewals to continue to assist families in calendar year 2023. This includes $50 million for the Rental Assistance Demonstration to further long-term financial stability and promote the energy or water efficiency, climate resilience, or preserva- tion of properties that convert to Project-Based Vouchers.

The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (P.L. 116–260) combined the Public Housing Capital Fund and the Public Housing Operating Fund into the new Public Housing Fund. The Public Housing Capital Fund con- tinues to make obligations and outlays from funds appropriated in 2020 and earlier.
                 Until 2005, the Housing Certificate Fund provided funding to both the project-based and tenant-based components of the Section 8 program. Project-Based Rental Assistance (PBRA) and Tenant-Based Rental Assist- ance are now funded in separate accounts. The Housing Certificate Fund retains and recovers balances from the previous years' appropriations and uses those balances to support PBRA contract renewals, amendments, and administration. ✦

   The Budget requests $250 million for Choice Neighborhoods to continue the transformation of neighborhoods of concentrated poverty into sustain- able, mixed-income neighborhoods with well-functioning services, schools, public assets, transportation, and access to jobs. The goal of the program is to transform distressed neighborhoods and improve the quality of life of current and future residents by coordinating and concentrating neighborhood investments from multiple sources. HUD will allocate up to $5 million for 10 to 12 Planning Grants and the remaining $235 million will fund four to six Implementation Grants.
In addition, the Budget includes $10 million under Choice Neighborhoods to fund the pilot Revitalization and Empowerment of Communities near Contaminated Lands through Assistance, Investment, and Mitigation (RECLAIM) program. The program will support community-driven efforts to revitalize distressed neighborhoods that contain public and/or HUD-as- sisted housing and are located on or near Superfund sites. RECLAIM leverages a coordinated interagency effort to identify, cleanup, and improve these sites by concentrating Federal resources. HUD will provide planning and implementation grants for pilot communities to improve health and safety, generate economic opportunities, and preserve or create affordable housing. ✦
REVITALIZATION OF SEVERELY DISTRESSED PUBLIC HOUSING (HOPE VI)
The HOPE VI program has accomplished its goal of contributing to the demolition of approximately 100,000 severely distressed Public Housing units. The Budget proposes no additional funds for this program. Instead, the Budget builds on the success of HOPE VI with the Choice Neighbor- hoods program, which makes a broad range of transformative investments in high-poverty neighborhoods where Public Housing and other HUD-as- sisted housing is located.

The Native Hawaiian Housing Loan Guarantee program (also known as the Section 184A program) provides access to private mortgage financing to Native Hawaiian families who are eligible to reside on Hawaiian home lands and would otherwise face barriers to acquiring such financing because of the unique legal status of the Hawaiian home lands. Since 2017, this program has operated on a negative subsidy basis, but the Budget requests $28 million in loan guarantee commitment authority to continue supporting these loans. ✦

The Community Development Fund account contains the following pro- grams:
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG).—The CDBG program provides formula grants to States, local governments, and Insular Areas to benefit mainly low- to moderate-income persons, and support a wide range of community and economic development activities, such as public infra- structure improvements (which account for approximately 36 percent of all CDBG funds), housing rehabilitation and construction (approximately 24 percent of funds), job creation and retention, and public services. After $7 million is allocated to Insular Areas, seventy percent of CDBG formula grants are distributed to mainly urban areas (entitlement communities), and 30 percent are distributed to States (non-entitlement communities). The Budget requests a total of $3.77 billion, of which $3.55 billion is funding for the CDBG program, and $195 million is for targeted CDBG activities aimed at removing barriers to revitalization in approximately 100 of the most underserved neighborhoods in the United States.
Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG).—The Budget requests ICDBG in the Native American Programs account.
CDBG Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR).—This account also contains a substantial amount of appropriated CDBG-DR funding provided to com- munities impacted by major disasters.
Recovery Housing (SUPPORT).—The Budget requests $25 million for activities authorized under the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. This formula program is allocated to states and the District of Columbia to provide temporary housing for individuals recovering from substance use disorders, including opioid✦s.

The Budget provides $455 million for the Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) program. HOPWA funding provides States and localities with resources to devise long-term comprehensive strategies for providing housing and supportive services to meet the housing needs of persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families.
Ninety percent of HOPWA funds is distributed to States and eligible metropolitan areas according to a formula, and the remaining ten percent is awarded competitively to States, local governments, and private nonprofit entities. The HOPWA formula, which was updated in 2016, allocates funds based on cases of persons living with HIV/AIDS and is adjusted for an area's fair market rent and poverty rates to further ensure HOPWA funds are focused on areas that have the most need. The updated formula became effective in 2017 with a five-year stop-loss/stop-gain period and is fully implemented as of fiscal year 2022. HUD continues to work closely with formula grantees through a comprehensive technical assistance initiative to support communities in implementing the local strategies developed during that five-year phase-in period to manage HOPWA formula changes. The Budget also proposes to not prioritize renewals in its competition so that funds are able to better support more evidence-based service delivery models, address current community needs, and fund innovative projects that support the administration✦'s goals of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030.

PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING
Program and Financing (in millions of dollars)
The Budget does not provide funding for the Rural Housing and Economic Development (RHED) program. RHED was created to support housing and economic development activities in rural communities. The Consolid- ated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Public Law 114–113) rescinded all unoblig- ated balances of RHED funds remaining in the account as of the end of 2016. ✦
REVOLVING FUND (LIQUIDATING PROGRAMS)
The Revolving Fund (liquidating programs) was established by the Inde- pendent Offices Appropriations Act of 1955 for the efficient liquidation of assets acquired under a number of housing and urban development programs, all of which are no longer active. For example, the Section 312 loan program portfolio, which provided first and junior lien financing at below market interest rates for the rehabilitation of homes in low-income neighborhoods, constituted a large portion of the account activities but has not originated new loans for over 20 years. The operational expenses are financed from a permanent, indefinite appropriation to administer the re- maining repayments of loans, recaptures, and lien releases in the portfolio. Any remaining unobligated balances in the account are returned to the Treasury annually.

The Housing Trust Fund was authorized by section 1131 of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–289), which directed the account to be funded from assessments on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Budget estimates that $393 million will be allocated in 2023 to the Housing Trust Fund to provide grants to States to increase and preserve the supply of affordable rental housing and homeownership opportunities for extremely low-income families. Funds will be distributed by formula to States to be used primarily for the construction, preservation, and rehab- ilitation of affordable rental housing for extremely low-income families, with up to ten percent of the funding available for similar eligible activities that support homeownership, and up to ten percent available for grantee administrative costs. ✦

 Program and Financing (in millions of dollars)
The Budget requests $15 billion for Project-Based Rental Assistance (PBRA), of which $400 million is requested as an advance appropriation to become available in 2024. The PBRA program assists approximately 1.2 million extremely low- to low-income households in obtaining decent, safe, and sanitary housing in private accommodations. PBRA serves fam- ilies, elderly, and disabled households and provides transitional housing for the homeless through the McKinney-Vento SRO program. Through this funding, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) supports approximately 17,200 contracts with private owners of multifamily housing by paying the difference between a portion of a household's income and the approved market-based rent for a housing unit. The Budget contin- ues to support the program's calendar year funding cycle and provides 12 months of funding for all contracts.
Program activities include the following:
Contract Renewals and Amendments.—These activities provide funding for HUD to renew expiring contracts and amend contracts that have not expired but require additional funding for HUD to meet remaining payment obligations. Appropriations for these activities are supplemented with re- coveries of excess balances remaining on expired contracts that utilized less resources than anticipated during their initial terms. This appropriation includes $60 million for the Rental Assistance Demonstration to further long-term financial stability and promote the energy or water efficiency or climate resilience of properties converting to project-based assistance.
Contract Administrators.—The Budget requests $375 million for contract administration. This activity funds the local level administration of the

The Other Assisted Housing Programs account contains the programs listed below:
Rent Supplement.—Rent Supplement assistance payments support assisted units for qualified low-income tenants.
Section 235.—The Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983 (Public Law 98–181) authorized a restructured Section 235 (Homeowner- ship Assistance) program that provided homeowners a ten-year interest reduction subsidy on their mortgages.
Section 236.—The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, as amended, authorized the Section 236 Rental Housing Assistance Program, which subsidizes the monthly mortgage payment that an owner of a rental or cooperative project is required to make. This interest subsidy reduces rents for lower income tenants. Some Section 236 properties also have rental assistance contracts with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) through the Rental Assistance Payment (RAP) pro- gram.
In 2019, HUD converted the last remaining Rent Supplement and RAP properties to long-term, project-based Section 8 contracts, using the Rental Assistance Demonstration pro✦gram.
                           The Housing for Persons With Disabilities Program (Section 811) supports the development and operation of supportive housing for very low-income people with disabilities. The Budget provides $287.7 million for this pro- gram, including $205 million to renew and amend operating subsidy con- tracts for existing Section 811 housing, $80 million for Capital Advances and new operating subsidy and State Project Rental Assistance to expand

DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT
The Green and Resilient Retrofit Program would provide funding to owners of Multifamily-assisted properties to rehabilitate these properties to be more energy and water efficient, healthier, and more resilient to ex- treme weather events. This increased investment will improve the stock of affordable housing available to many low- and extremely low-income families, often from marginalized communities. This program would support climate resilience, reduce the likelihood of catastrophic damage from future disasters, reduce energy and water consumption, and improve indoor air quality. The Budget requests $250 million for grants and loans for properties currently assisted under Project-Based Rental Assistance, Housing for the Elderly, and Housing for Persons with Disabilities, including $31.5 million for data collection and utility consumption benchmarking of properties across multifamily housing. ✦

    The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) provides mortgage insurance for the purchase, refinance and rehabilitation of single-family homes. FHA mortgage insurance is designed to encourage lenders to make credit avail- able to borrowers whom the conventional market does not adequately serve, including first-time homebuyers, minorities, lower-income families and residents of underserved areas (central cities and rural areas). Historically, FHA has also provided countercyclical support in times of economic crisis. For budgetary purposes, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund is separated into three risk categories: forward loans, Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs), and a proposed Home Equity Accelerator Loan (HEAL) pilot. Forward programs guarantee loans for standard single- family purchases and refinances (Section 203(b) program), home improve- ments (Section 203(k) program) and condominiums. HECMs, also known as reverse mortgages, enable elderly homeowners to borrow against the equity in their homes without having to make repayments during their lifetime. HEAL, a new positive subsidy pilot, would offer loan products designed to lower barriers to homeownership for first-generation and/or low-wealth first-time homebuyers.
The Budget requests $165 million for the MMI Program account. This includes $150 million in administrative expenses to support a range of FHA functions, such as loan underwriting, claims processing and risk

monitoring. Additionally, the Budget provides $15 million in credit subsidy for the new HEAL pilot.
The Budget also requests a limitation of $400 billion on loan guarantees for the MMI Fund. The Budget projects insurance of $225 billion in forward mortgages, $26.4 billion in HECMs, and $3.4 billion in HEAL pilot loans, with additional commitment authority available in case these amounts are exceeded during execution.

The HOPE for Homeowners program was created by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 to help homeowners at risk of default and foreclosure refinance into affordable, sustainable loans. Under the program, eligible homeowners refinanced their current mortgage loans into a new mortgage insured by FHA. The program ended on September 30, 2011. In 2016, excess HOPE Bond proceeds in the amount of $455 million were transferred to the HOPE Reserve Fund, and used to retire the HOPE Bonds. Remaining HOPE Bond activ✦ity is shown in the HOPE Reserve Fund.

      Summary of Loan Levels, Subsidy Budget Authority and Outlays by Program (in millions of dollars)
The Federal Housing Administration's General Insurance and Special Risk Insurance (GI/SRI) programs provide mortgage insurance for a variety of purposes, including financing for the development and rehabilitation of multifamily housing, residential care facilities, and hospitals. The Budget requests a limitation of $35 billion on loan guarantees for the GI/SRI Fund. GI/SRI's mortgage insurance programs are designed to operate without the need for subsidy appropriations, with fees set higher than anticipated losses. Therefore, the Budget does not request an appropriation of new credit subsidy funds.
GI/SRI programs guarantee loans at 100 percent, with three exceptions where other parties guarantee a portion of the loan: Housing Finance Agency Risk Sharing, Qualified Participating Entity Risk Sharing, and Federal Financing Bank Risk Sharing.

GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION
The Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) was established by Federal charter in 1968. It is a wholly-owned Government corporation within HUD. It was established to support Federal housing initiatives by providing liquidity to the secondary mortgage market and to attract capital from the global capital markets for the Nation's mortgage markets. Its primary function is to guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that are backed by loans insured or guaranteed by FHA, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Rural Develop- ment in the Department of Agriculture, and HUD's Office of Public and Indian Housing. ✦

to offset the expenses incurred by the Department in carrying out the re- sponsibilities under the authorizing legislation. The Budget proposes to fully fund the $14 million cost of authorized activities with these fees.
Thirty-three States participate in the program under Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) approved State compliance plans and are partially reimbursed by HUD for their activities. HUD administers a compliance program for the remaining 17 States. HUD coordinates the Manufactured Housing Consensus Committee to recommend revisions to and interpretations of the manufactured housing standards and regulations. HUD also develops and implements model standards for installation of manufactured housing, as well as an installation enforcement program. HUD administers installation enforcement programs in 14 States and oversees HUD-approved programs in 36 States. Finally, HUD administers a dispute resolution program for manufactured housing homeowners, retail- ers, installers, and manufacturers in 24 States and oversees HUD-approved dispute resolution programs in 26 States.

FAIR HOUSING ACTIVITIES
   For contracts, grants, and other assistance, not otherwise provided for, as author- ized by title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.), and section 561 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (42 U.S.C. 3616a), $86,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2024: Provided, That notwith- standing section 3302 of title 31, United States Code, the Secretary may assess and collect fees to cover the costs of the Fair Housing Training Academy, and may use such funds to develop on-line courses and provide such training: Provided further, That none of the funds made available under this heading may be used to lobby the executive or legislative branches of the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan: Provided further, That of the funds made available under this heading, $1,000,000 shall be available to the Secretary for the creation and promotion of translated materials and other programs that support the assistance of persons with limited English proficiency in utilizing the services provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Note.—A full-year 2022 appropriation for this account was not enacted at the time the Budget was prepared; therefore, the Budget assumes this account is operating under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2022 (Division A of Public Law 117–43, as amended). The amounts included for 2022 reflect the annualized level provided by the continuing resolution.
     Program and Financing (in millions of dollars)
                The Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970 directs the Secretary to undertake programs of research, studies, testing, and demonstrations related to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) mission. These functions are carried out by HUD's Office of Policy Devel- opment and Research (PD&R) through in-house analysis by staff; contracts with industry, nonprofit research organizations, and educational institutions; and cooperative agreements with educational, governmental, and philan- thropic entities. In addition, centralized technical assistance for the Depart- ment is supported through this account; these funds enable HUD to support its partners with better coordinated, cross-program technical assistance rather than conventional, program-specific assistance.
The Budget requests $145 million for HUD's Research and Technology (R&T) program. R&T investments support HUD's enterprise-wide commit- ment to integrate evidence and cross-disciplinary intelligence throughout program policy, management, and operations. The request consists of $70 million for core research support, surveys, data infrastructure, and know- ledge management (i.e., research dissemination); $25 million for research, evaluations, and demonstrations; and $50 million for technical assistance.

 The Budget requests $86 million for fair housing activities to support efforts to end housing discrimination. Of the amount requested, $26 million is for the Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP); $56 million is for the Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP); $3 million is for the National Fair Housing Training Academy (NFHTA); and $1 million is for the Limited English Proficiency Initiative (LEPI).
FHAP provides funding to State and local agencies to assure prompt and effective processing of complaints under substantially equivalent State and local fair housing laws. To be eligible for assistance through FHAP, an agency must administer a fair housing law that HUD has certified as sub- stantially equivalent to the Federal Fair Housing Act.
FHIP provides funding to States and local governments, and to public and private non-profit organizations, that administer programs to prevent or eliminate discriminatory housing practices through enforcement, educa- tion, and outreach. These grants allow the organizations to provide fair housing enforcement through testing in the rental and sales markets, to file fair housing complaints to HUD, and to conduct investigations. Further, the education and outreach activities these organizations conduct also help to educate the public, housing providers, and local governments about their rights and responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act.
The NFHTA provides comprehensive fair housing and civil rights training for investigators, local agencies, educators, attorneys, industry representat- ives, and other housing industry professionals.
LEPI provides funds for oral interpretation and written translation ser- vices, which help make HUD programs and activities accessible to people who are not proficient in English.

        The primary purpose of the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Control Grant program is to reduce the exposure of young children to lead-based paint and other environmental hazards in their homes, including protecting them from permanent developmental problems and asthma, and exposure to pesticides and carbon monoxide.
The program plays a critical role in addressing the number one environ- mental disease impacting children: lead poisoning. The Budget requests $400 million, including $305 million for the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Lead Hazard Control Grants and Lead Hazard Reduction Demonstration Program; $85 million for the Healthy Homes Program, of which $10 million will be for safety and functional home modification repairs and renovations for low-income elderly homeowners; $5 million for a radon testing and mitigation demonstration program; and $5 million for lead-based paint technical studies and support. The Budget includes an appropriations provision that would allow the transfer of un- obligated balances and recaptured funds from undersubscribed competitive programs to other competitive programs experiencing oversubscription.
The Lead Hazard Control Grant Program provides grants of $1 million to $5 million to State and local governments and Indian Tribes for control of lead-based paint hazards in pre–1978 private unassisted rental and owner-occupied housing of low-income families. The grants are also de- signed to facilitate the development of a housing maintenance and rehabil- itation workforce trained in lead-safe work practices and a certified hazard evaluation and control industry. In awarding grants HUD promotes the use of new low-cost approaches to hazard control that can be replicated across the nation.
The Healthy Homes program enables HUD to assess and control housing- related hazards that contribute to diseases and injuries of children and other vulnerable populations. With funding from this program, grantees implement and evaluate methods for controlling two or more housing-re- lated diseases through a single intervention. Healthy Homes funding is also used to provide technical support and training and assist in the completion of national surveys and other studies. In addition, the program conducts education and outreach to help State, local and non-governmental agencies, housing industry stakeholders, and the public understand the health and housing relationship and identify and address housing-related health and safety hazards.
The Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes will continue its lead-based paint technical studies and support activities, which include public education; support for State and local agencies, private property owners, HUD programs and field offices, and professional organizations; technical studies to improve program policy and implementation; quality control to ensure that the evaluation and control of lead-based paint hazards is done properly in HUD-assisted housing; and development of standards,

SEC. 214. The Secretary is authorized to transfer up to 10 percent or $5,000,000, whichever is less, of funds appropriated for any office under the headings "Admin- istrative Support Offices" or "Program Offices" to any other such office : Provided, That the Secretary shall provide notification to the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations three business days in advance of any such transfers: Provided further, That no appropriation for any such office shall be increased or decreased by more than 10 percent or $5,000,000, whichever is less, unless such Committees are notified in writing ten business days in advance of any such transfers.
SEC. 215.

(3) Such requirements shall apply to insured and noninsured projects with assistance attached to the units under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f), but shall not apply to such units assisted under section 8(o)(13) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(13)) or to public housing units assisted with capital or operating funds under section 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g).
(c)
(1) Within 15 days of the issuance of the Real Estate Assessment Center

The Secretary shall provide a copy of the Notice of Default to the tenants, the local government, any mortgagees, and any contract adminis- trator. If the owner's appeal results in a UPCS score of 60 or above, the Secretary may withdraw the Notice of Default.

(I) take any other regulatory or contractual remedies available as deemed necessary and appropriate by the Secretary.
(d) The Secretary shall take appropriate steps to ensure that project-based contracts remain in effect, subject to the exercise of contractual abatement remedies to assist relocation of tenants for major threats to health and safety after written notice to the affected tenants. To the extent the Secretary determines, in consultation with the tenants and the local government, that the property is not feasible for continued rental assistance payments under such section 8 or other programs, based on consideration of—
(1) the costs of rehabilitating and operating the property and all available Federal, State, and local resources, including rent adjustments under section 524 of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 ("MAHRAA"); and
(2) environmental conditions that cannot be remedied in a cost-effective fashion, the Secretary may contract for project-based rental assistance payments with an owner or owners of other existing housing properties, or provide other rental assistance.
